# 🧮 rtfw-math-rs

![build](https://github.com/RTFW-rs/rtfw-math-rs/actions/workflows/rust.yml/badge.svg)

This is a weak implementation of some Math functions because I needed them for the [Base 64 encoding](https://github.com/RTFW-rs/rtfw-base64-rs) implementation.

It will get fixed later with performance tests and a solid `lcm` and `gcd` implem (hopefully).
